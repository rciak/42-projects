* The stuff in this folder should be thouroughly tested before using it.

* Previously the following was in ../libft.h

  ```C
  //sideproducts/ft_x_strtools2.c
  size_t	strlen_deli(const char *s, const char *deli);
  size_t	count_words(const char *s, const char *deli);
  char	**split_deli(char const *s, const char *deli);
  ```
